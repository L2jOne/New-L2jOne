Collect 1 Star Ornament, 4 Bead Ornaments, 10 Fir Tree Branches, and 1 Flower Pot. Bring these ingredients and I'll make you a marvelous Christmas Tree! You can gather these ingredients by killing monsters all throughout the world. <br>

Collect 10 Regular Christmas Trees and bring them to me. I will make you a very Special Christmas Tree! This tree has the ability to restore HP and MP of those who come near it.<br>
