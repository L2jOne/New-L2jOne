<body>Santa Trainee:<br>
Do you want a Christmas gift?  I'm sorry, my dear child, but I'm just a trainee and don't have any presents for you. All I have to give is this <font color="LEVEL">Santa's Hat</font>, which can only be worn by those who show love for others. Hmm, what should I do?<br>
I'll tell you what! Recently, I've been collecting Christmas Trees for our destitute neighbors. If you'll collect <font color="LEVEL">ten Christmas Trees</font>, I'll let you have this Santa's Hat! What do you think?<br>
